## 2048

Here is my implementation of the popular game 2048. As always I avoid following tutorials. Instead my approach is to find my onw solutions. Only when I come across an obstacle will I look into the source code of other implementations and search for their solution to a certain issue.

#### Tech

- Astro
- vanilla Javascript

At the moment my target is to take a step back from react and use vanilla javascript and no libaries. I plan to write a post about my reasons for this in a future date. But short answer, I want to learn why and when to use react. To understand what problems it seeks to answer. And this is done by personally walking into those problems!

However, due to my wish to bring all my projects on to my personal website, a component framework is very useful. After a bit of research I decided to use Atstro, due to its ability to create 'almost' vanilla like components.


#### Progress

Currently focused on impleenting functionality over design.

- Base functionality is working. Tiles move and merge correctly.
  - Current implementation is unable to hand rapid keyboard presses
